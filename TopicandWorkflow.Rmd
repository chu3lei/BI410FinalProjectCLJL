## Workflow plan (prose)
1) Cleaning & validation:
  First we'll subset the data to only contain observations from Oregon coastal areas. Next, we'll make sure that each column contains only a single data type.
2) Aggregations/derivations:
  We'll add a column "native_plant" to our dataset that's TRUE if the plant is native to Oregon and FALSE if not. [Where will that info come from? Dr. Ponisio suggested I do it by hand using ] We'll also add a "native_bee" column that's TRUE if the bee species is native to Oregon and FALSE if not. [Dr. Ponisio told me that there are few non-native bees besides the European honey bee, but we need a way to determine this.]
3) Functions/loops (inputs → outputs): …  
4) Statistical test + programmatic implementation: …  
5) Planned visualizations/tables: …  
6) Risks & mitigations: …
