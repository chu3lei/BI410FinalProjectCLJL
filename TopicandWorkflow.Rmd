### Paragraph 5 — Hypotheses (directional) & brief rationale
- H1: I predict native plants will attract more bee species than nonnative plants in the coastal region because specialist bees evolved with native plants.  
- H2: I predict native plants will attract more bees visits than nonnative plants in the coastal region because ... .  

## Dataset identification

## Workflow plan (prose)
1) Cleaning & validation:
  First, with Oregon Ecoregions data from GEOHub (https://geohub.oregon.gov/datasets/oregon-geo::oregon-ecoregions/explore?location=44.166791%2C-122.744817%2C8.00) we'll subset the data to only contain observations from Oregon coastal areas 1a (Coastal Lowlands) and a2 (Coastal Uplands). Next, we'll make sure that each column contains only a single data type.
2) Aggregations/derivations:
  We'll add a column "native_plant" to our dataset that's TRUE if the plant is native to Oregon and FALSE if not and fill it with information obtained from Oregon Flora (oregonflora.org). We'll also add a "native_bee" column that's TRUE if the bee species is native to Oregon and FALSE if not. [Dr. Ponisio told me that there are few non-native bees besides the European honey bee, but we need a way to determine this. Or perhaps we could use only European honey bees (since they're the "big invasive") to stand-in for non-native bees.]
3) Functions/loops (inputs → outputs): …  

4) Statistical test + programmatic implementation: 
- I will use A/B testing and shuffle the labels to see if there is a statistical difference between the native and non-native plants. Use Shannon diversity. Richmond should be okay. 

5) Planned visualizations/tables: …  
6) Risks & mitigations: …
