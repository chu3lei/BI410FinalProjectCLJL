## Dataset identification

  We will be using two additional datasets to address our question. The first is a shapefile of Oregon ecoregion data from geohub.oregon.gov (https://geohub.oregon.gov/datasets/oregon-geo::oregon-ecoregions/explore?location=44.148189%2C-122.744817%2C8.00). The data was compiled by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), the U.S. Forest Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, and the Oregon Natural Heritage Program working in collaboration. The attributes associated with the file are an object id for each polygon, its area, perimeter, three ecoregion codes, ecoregion name, a level 3 ecoregion code, a level 3 ecoregion name, the Oregon Natural Heritage Program code, the Oregon Natural Heritage Program name, a Nature Conservancy Region code, a Nature Conservancy Region name, shape area, and shape length. We will be using the "ECO" and "NAME" attributes, which are associated with small-scale Oregon ecoregions.

## Workflow plan (prose)
1) Cleaning & validation:
  First, with Oregon Ecoregions data from GEOHub (https://geohub.oregon.gov/datasets/oregon-geo::oregon-ecoregions/explore?location=44.166791%2C-122.744817%2C8.00) we'll subset the data to only contain observations from Oregon coastal areas 1a (Coastal Lowlands) and a2 (Coastal Uplands). Next, we'll make sure that each column contains only a single data type.
2) Aggregations/derivations:
  We'll add a column "native_plant" to our dataset that's TRUE if the plant is native to Oregon and FALSE if not and fill it with information obtained from Oregon Flora (oregonflora.org). We'll also add a "native_bee" column that's TRUE if the bee species is native to Oregon and FALSE if not. [Dr. Ponisio told me that there are few non-native bees besides the European honey bee, but we need a way to determine this. Or perhaps we could use only European honey bees (since they're the "big invasive") to stand-in for non-native bees.]
3) Functions/loops (inputs → outputs): …  

4) Statistical test + programmatic implementation: 
- I will use A/B testing and shuffle the labels to see if there is a statistical difference between the native and non-native plants. Use Shannon diversity. Richmond should be okay. 

5) Planned visualizations/tables: …  
6) Risks & mitigations: …
